# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior using Python and Pandas to understand how age, visit frequency and satisfaction impact on monthly spending.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 50 customers with the following features:

- CustomerID  
- Age  
- MonthlySpend  
- VisitsPerMonth  
- SatisfactionScore  

The data simulates customer behavior for a retail business.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
- Do loyal customers spend more?
- Which age group spend more?
- Does customer satisfaction increase revenue?
- What type of customers are most valuable?

---

## 🧹 Data Analysis
The following steps were performed:

- Descriptive statistics
- Group-based aggregation
- Customer segmentation (loyal vs normal)
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with higher satisfaction (score 4) spend the most.
- Age of above 30 spend more.
- Very unhappy customers spend significantly less.
- Visit frequency alone does not strongly predict spending.
- Loyal customers are not always high spenders.

---

## 📊 Visualizations
Graphs were created to show:

- Satisfaction vs Spending  
- Visits vs Spending  
- Loyalty vs Revenue  

These visuals help understand customer behavior patterns.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics can be used to identify high-value customers and understand what drives revenue.
